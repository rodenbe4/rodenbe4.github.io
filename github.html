      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
	  <p>My name is Kayla Rodenbeck, and I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  This website is still a work in progress, but eventually will serve as a multi-page site showcasing my skills in software development and coding.</p>
      <p>For the time being, feel free to check out some of my recent projects at the GitHub repositories below:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/cutefluffykittens/ScavengerHunt">eScavenge</a><br/>&emsp;This is the group project we completed as part of our software engineering course, implemented in three two-week sprints.  It works as a scavenger hunt styled after the TV show <em>The Amazing Race,</em> where teams compete to reach specific destinations hinted at by clues, and need to be the first team to reach the final destination to win.<br/>&emsp;Our program allows for two different end users: a "gamemaker", who is in charge of creating the game itself and position the landmarks, clues, and hints; and the "team" who is responsible for answering the questions about each landmark correctly before being allowed to move on to the next landmark.  The team who reaches the last landmark first and correctly answers its question is the winner, although the rest of the teams may continue playing until they either finish or forfeit.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/rodenbe4/Minesweeper">Minesweeper</a><br/>&emsp;A personal project completed this summer that serves as a replica of the popular Microsoft game.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/rodenbe4/Semester-Schedule">Semester Schedule</a><br/>&emsp;In our System Programming class, we created a program using C++ that will allow a user to create a course schedule for a given semester.  The assignment was designed to utilize C++ classes, as well as file I/O.  Each class has a course code, days of the week met, a time period, and a teacher.  The program allows the user to be able to add a class, remove a class, validate the current schedule to make sure that no teacher is teaching any two courses at the same time, and clear the schedule in its entirety.  The user can also import a schedule from a file, or export a schedule into its own file.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>In addition, in the compilers course that I took in Spring 2018 I worked extensively on building a for a language called Cool, but do not currently have permission to publish the code for this project.  Please feel free to contact me if you would like any more information regarding this project.</p>
	  <p>I will also be working on my Capstone project throughout the Fall 2018 semester, though since it has yet to begin, I don't have any details to provide on it yet.</p>
