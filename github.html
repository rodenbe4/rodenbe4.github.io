      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
	  <p>My name is Kayla Rodenbeck, and I'm a senior Computer Science student at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.  This website is still a work in progress, but eventually will serve as a multi-page site showcasing my skills in software development and coding.</p>
      <p>For the time being, please check out some of my recent projects at the following GitHub repositories:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://github.com/cutefluffykittens/ScavengerHunt">eScavenge</a><br/>&emsp;This is the group project we completed as part of our software engineering course, implemented in three two-week sprints.  It works as a scavenger hunt styled after the TV show <em>The Amazing Race,</em> where teams compete to reach specific destinations hinted at by clues, and need to be the first team to reach the final destination to win.<br/>&emsp;Our program allows for two different end users: a "gamemaker", who is in charge of creating the game itself and position the landmarks, clues, and hints; and the "team" who is responsible for answering the questions about each landmark correctly before being allowed to move on to the next landmark.  The team who reaches the last landmark first and correctly answers its question is the winner, although the rest of the teams may continue playing until they either finish or forfeit.</li>
